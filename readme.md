Skycons is a set of ten animated weather glyphs, procedurally generated by
JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas tag. They're easy to use, and pretty
lightweight, so they shouldn't rain on your parade:

```html
<canvas id="icon1" width="128" height="128"></canvas>
<canvas id="icon2" width="128" height="128"></canvas>
```

```js
import Skycons from "skycons-modern"

var skycons = new Skycons({"color": "pink"});
// on Android, a nasty hack is needed: {"resizeClear": true}

// you can add a canvas by it's ID...
skycons.add("icon1", Skycons.PARTLY_CLOUDY_DAY);

// ...or by the canvas DOM element itself.
skycons.add(document.getElementById("icon2"), Skycons.RAIN);

// if you're using the Forecast API, you can also supply
// strings: "partly-cloudy-day" or "rain".

// start animation!
skycons.play();

// you can also halt animation with skycons.pause()

// want to change the icon? no problem:
skycons.set("icon1", Skycons.PARTLY_CLOUDY_NIGHT);

// want to remove one altogether? no problem:
skycons.remove("icon2");
```

This is our rework for making the library itself more modern.

- Added package.json
- Add linting infrastructure + prettier
- Added babel for transpiling source code
- Removed commented out code to make things cleaner
- Added tooling for bundling script for publishing

and more...
